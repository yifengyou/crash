USAGE:

  crash [OPTION]... NAMELIST MEMORY-IMAGE[@ADDRESS]	(dumpfile form)
  crash [OPTION]... [NAMELIST]             		(live system form)

OPTIONS:

  NAMELIST
    This is a pathname to an uncompressed kernel image (a vmlinux
    file), or a Xen hypervisor image (a xen-syms file) which has
    been compiled with the "-g" option.  If using the dumpfile form,
    a vmlinux file may be compressed in either gzip or bzip2 formats.

  MEMORY-IMAGE
    A kernel core dump file created by the netdump, diskdump, LKCD
    kdump, xendump or kvmdump facilities.

    If a MEMORY-IMAGE argument is not entered, the session will be
    invoked on the live system, which typically requires root privileges
    because of the device file used to access system RAM.  By default, 
    /dev/crash will be used if it exists.  If it does not exist, then 
    /dev/mem will be used; but if the kernel has been configured with 
    CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, then /proc/kcore will be used.  It is permissible
    to explicitly enter /dev/crash, /dev/mem or /proc/kcore.

    An @ADDRESS value must be appended to the MEMORY-IMAGE if the dumpfile
    is a raw RAM dumpfile that has no header information describing the file
    contents.  Multiple MEMORY-IMAGE@ADDRESS ordered pairs may be entered,
    with each dumpfile containing a contiguous block of RAM, where the ADDRESS
    value is the physical start address of the block expressed in hexadecimal.
    The physical address value(s) will be used to create a temporary ELF header
    in /var/tmp, which will only exist during the crash session.  If a raw RAM
    dumpfile represents a live memory source, such as that specified by the QEMU
    mem-path argument of a memory-backend-file object, then "live:" must be
    prepended to the MEMORY-IMAGE name.

  mapfile
    If the NAMELIST file is not the same kernel that is running
    (live system form), or the kernel that was running when the system
    crashed (dumpfile form), then the System.map file of the original 
    kernel should be entered on the command line.

  -h [option]
  --help [option]
    Without an option argument, display a crash usage help message.
    If the option argument is a crash command name, the help page
    for that command is displayed.  If it is the string "input", a
    page describing the various crash command line input options is
    displayed.  If it is the string "output", a page describing command
    line output options is displayed.  If it is the string "all", then
    all of the possible help messages are displayed.  After the help
    message is displayed, crash exits.

  -s     
    Silently proceed directly to the "crash>" prompt without displaying
    any version, GPL, or crash initialization data during startup, and by
    default, runtime command output is not passed to any scrolling command.

  -i file
    Execute the command(s) contained in "file" prior to displaying 
    the "crash>" prompt for interactive user input.

  -d num 
    Set the internal debug level.  The higher the number, the more
    debugging data will be printed when crash initializes and runs.

  -S     
    Use /boot/System.map as the mapfile.

  -e  vi | emacs
    Set the readline(3) command  line editing mode to "vi" or "emacs".  
    The default editing mode is "vi".

  -f     
    Force the usage of a compressed vmlinux file if its original
    name does not start with "vmlinux".

  -k     
    Indicate that the NAMELIST file is an LKCD "Kerntypes" debuginfo file.

  -g [namelist]
    Determine if a vmlinux or xen-syms namelist file contains debugging data.

  -t     
    Display the system-crash timestamp and exit.

  -L     
    Attempt to lock all of its virtual address space into memory by
    calling mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE) during initialization.
    If the system call fails, an error message will be displayed,
    but the session continues.

  -c tty-device
    Open the tty-device as the console used for debug messages.

  -p page-size
    If a processor's page size cannot be determined by the dumpfile, 
    and the processor default cannot be used, use page-size.

  -o filename
    Only used with the MEMORY-IMAGE@ADDRESS format for raw RAM dumpfiles,
    specifies a filename of a new ELF vmcore that will be created and used
    as the dumpfile.  It will be saved to allow future use as a standalone
    vmcore, replacing the original raw RAM dumpfile.

  -m option=value
  --machdep option=value
    Pass an option and value pair to machine-dependent code.  These
    architecture-specific option/pairs should only be required in
    very rare circumstances:

    X86_64:
      phys_base=<physical-address>
      irq_eframe_link=<value>
      irq_stack_gap=<value>
      max_physmem_bits=<value>
      kernel_image_size=<value>
      vm=orig       (pre-2.6.11 virtual memory address ranges)
      vm=2.6.11     (2.6.11 and later virtual memory address ranges)
      vm=xen        (Xen kernel virtual memory address ranges)
      vm=xen-rhel4  (RHEL4 Xen kernel virtual address ranges)
      vm=5level     (5-level page tables)
      page_offset=<PAGE_OFFSET-value>
    PPC64:
      vm=orig
      vm=2.6.14     (4-level page tables)
    IA64:
      phys_start=<physical-address>
      init_stack_size=<size>
      vm=4l         (4-level page tables)
    ARM:
      phys_base=<physical-address>
    ARM64:
      phys_offset=<physical-address>
      kimage_voffset=<kimage_voffset-value>
      max_physmem_bits=<value>
      vabits_actual=<value>
    X86:
      page_offset=<CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET-value>

  -x     
    Automatically load extension modules from a particular directory.
    The directory is determined by the following order of precedence:

    (1) the directory specified in the CRASH_EXTENSIONS shell 
        environment variable
    (2) /usr/lib64/crash/extensions  (64-bit  architectures)
    (3) /usr/lib/crash/extensions  (32-bit architectures)
    (4) the ./extensions subdirectory of the current directory

  --active
    Track only the active task on each cpu.

  --buildinfo
    Display the crash binary's build date, the user ID of the builder,
    the hostname of the machine where the build was done, the target
    architecture, the version number, and the compiler version.

  --memory_module modname
    Use the modname as an alternative kernel module to the crash.ko
    module that creates the /dev/crash device.

  --memory_device device
    Use device as an alternative device to the /dev/crash, /dev/mem
    or /proc/kcore devices.

  --log dumpfile
    Dump the contents of the kernel log buffer.  A kernel namelist
    argument is not necessary, but the dumpfile must contain the
    VMCOREINFO data taken from the original /proc/vmcore ELF header.

  --no_kallsyms
    Do not use kallsyms-generated symbol information contained within
    kernel module object files.

  --no_modules
    Do not access or display any kernel module related information.

  --no_ikconfig
    Do not attempt to read configuration data that was built into
    kernels configured with CONFIG_IKCONFIG.

  --no_data_debug
    Do not verify the validity of all structure member offsets and
    structure sizes that it uses.

  --no_kmem_cache
    Do not initialize the kernel's slab cache infrastructure, and
    commands that use kmem_cache-related data will not work.

  --no_elf_notes
    Do not use the registers from the ELF NT_PRSTATUS notes saved
    in a compressed kdump header for backtraces.

  --kmem_cache_delay
    Delay the initialization of the kernel's slab cache infrastructure
    until it is required by a run-time command.

  --readnow
    Pass this flag to the embedded gdb module, which will override
    the two-stage strategy that it uses for reading symbol tables
    from the NAMELIST.  If module symbol tables are loaded during
    runtime with the "mod" command, the same override will occur.

  --smp  
    Specify that the system being analyzed is an SMP kernel.

  -v
  --version
    Display the version of the crash utility, the version of the
    embedded gdb module, GPL information, and copyright notices.

  --cpus number
    Specify the number of cpus in the SMP system being analyzed.

  --osrelease dumpfile
    Display the OSRELEASE vmcoreinfo string from a kdump dumpfile
    header.

  --hyper
    Force the session to be that of a Xen hypervisor.

  --p2m_mfn pfn
    When a Xen Hypervisor or its dom0 kernel crashes, the dumpfile
    is typically analyzed with either the Xen hypervisor or the dom0
    kernel.  It is also possible to analyze any of the guest domU
    kernels if the pfn_to_mfn_list_list pfn value of the guest kernel
    is passed on the command line along with its NAMELIST and the 
    dumpfile.

  --xen_phys_start physical-address
    Supply the base physical address of the Xen hypervisor's text
    and static data for older xendump dumpfiles that did not pass
    that information in the dumpfile header.

  --zero_excluded
    If the makedumpfile(8) facility has filtered a compressed kdump
    dumpfile to exclude various types of non-essential pages, or has
    marked a compressed or ELF kdump dumpfile as incomplete due to
    an ENOSPC or other error during its creation, any attempt to
    read missing pages will fail.  With this flag, reads from any
    of those pages will return zero-filled memory.

  --no_panic
    Do not attempt to find the task that was running when the kernel
    crashed.  Set the initial context to that of the "swapper"  task
    on cpu 0.

  --more 
    Use /bin/more as the command output scroller, overriding the
    default of /usr/bin/less and any settings in either ./.crashrc
    or $HOME/.crashrc.

  --less 
    Use /usr/bin/less as the command output scroller, overriding any
    settings in either ./.crashrc or $HOME/.crashrc.

  --CRASHPAGER
    Use the output paging command defined in the CRASHPAGER shell
    environment variable, overriding any settings in either ./.crashrc 
    or $HOME/.crashrc.

  --no_scroll
    Do not pass run-time command output to any scrolling command.

  --no_strip
    Do not strip cloned kernel text symbol names.

  --no_crashrc
    Do not execute the commands in either $HOME/.crashrc or ./.crashrc.

  --mod directory
    When loading the debuginfo data of kernel modules with the "mod -S"
    command, search for their object files in directory instead of in 
    the standard location.

  --src directory
    Search for the kernel source code in directory instead of in the
    standard location that is compiled into the debuginfo data.

  --reloc size
    When analyzing live x86 kernels configured with a CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START 
    value that is larger than its CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN value, then it will
    be necessary to enter a relocation size equal to the difference between
    the two values.

  --hash count
    Set the number of internal hash queue heads used for list gathering
    and verification.  The default count is 32768.

  --kaslr offset | auto
    If x86, x86_64 or s390x kernel was configured with CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE,
    the offset value is equal to the difference between the symbol values 
    compiled into the vmlinux file and their relocated KASLR value.  If
    set to auto, the KASLR offset value will be automatically calculated.

  --minimal
    Bring up a session that is restricted to the log, dis, rd, sym,
    eval, set and exit commands.  This option may provide a way to
    extract some minimal/quick information from a corrupted or truncated
    dumpfile, or in situations where one of the several kernel subsystem 
    initialization routines would abort the crash session.

  --kvmhost [32|64]
    When examining an x86 KVM guest dumpfile, this option specifies
    that the KVM host that created the dumpfile was an x86 (32-bit)
    or an x86_64 (64-bit) machine, overriding the automatically
    determined value.

  --kvmio <size>
    override the automatically-calculated KVM guest I/O hole size.

  --offline [show|hide]
    Show or hide command output that is associated with offline cpus,
    overriding any settings in either ./.crashrc or $HOME/.crashrc.

FILES:

  .crashrc
    Initialization commands.  The file can be located in the user's
    HOME directory and/or the current directory.  Commands found in
    the .crashrc file in the HOME directory are executed before
    those in the current directory's .crashrc file.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

  EDITOR 
    Command input is read using readline(3).  If EDITOR is set to
    emacs or vi then suitable keybindings are used.  If EDITOR is
    not set, then vi is used.  This can be overridden by "set vi" or
    "set emacs" commands located in a .crashrc file, or by entering
    "-e emacs" on the crash command line.

  CRASHPAGER
    If CRASHPAGER is set, its value is used as the name of the program
    to which command output will be sent.  If not, then command output
    output is sent to "/usr/bin/less -E -X" by default.

  CRASH_MODULE_PATH
    Specifies an alternative directory tree to search for kernel
    module object files.

  CRASH_EXTENSIONS
    Specifies a directory containing extension modules that will be
    loaded automatically if the -x command line option is used.
